# CROWDFUNDING_ETL

For the ETL mini project I am practicing on building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, I have created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, I will upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
